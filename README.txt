COMPLEXITY [EASY / HARD]: HARD

I enjoyed this assignment a lot.  Adding in multiple services and creating new views made this seem like the closest app to a newer type of app. 


APPROXIMATION OF HOURS INVESTED IN ASSIGNMENT:
7.5 hours


EXPECTED GRADE: A


DESCRIBE APPLICATION INTENT:
The user types in a search text.  That text will then be sent to an call to Wikipedia to return the search results from there.  Then it will be used to call giphy for results from there. 

I will then output all of the results from wiki and 3 of the results from giphy.  

In order to see search history, the user can click on the search history tab.  To get back to the search bar, the user can click on the search tab. I used a new search component for the app component functionality rather than  and used the app component to be the top ribbon.
